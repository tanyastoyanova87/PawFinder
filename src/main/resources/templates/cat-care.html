            <h2>Cat Care Guide: Essential Tips for a Happy & Healthy Cat</h2>
            <p>Cats are independent yet affectionate companions that thrive with proper care and attention. Whether
                you're a first-time cat owner or looking to refine your pet care routine, here’s everything you need to
                know to keep your feline friend happy and healthy.</p>

            <h3>Nutrition & Feeding</h3>
            <p>A well-balanced diet is essential for your cat’s health. Kittens up to 12 months old require specially
                formulated food that supports their rapid growth. Adult cats need a diet suited to their activity level,
                ensuring they get the right balance of proteins, fats, and essential nutrients. Always provide fresh,
                clean
                water to keep them hydrated. Be cautious with certain human foods—chocolate, onions, garlic, and dairy
                products can be toxic and should be avoided.</p>

            <h3>Litter Box Maintenance</h3>
            <p>Keeping your cat’s litter box clean is crucial for their hygiene and comfort. Using a high-quality litter
                that clumps well and controls odor will make maintenance easier. The litter box should be cleaned daily
                and fully changed regularly to prevent unpleasant smells and bacteria buildup. Ideally, there should be
                one litter box per cat plus an extra, placed in a quiet and easily accessible spot.</p>

            <h3>Grooming & Hygiene</h3>
            <p>Regular grooming helps keep your cat’s coat healthy and reduces shedding. Long-haired breeds especially
                benefit from frequent brushing to prevent matting and hairballs. Claw trimming every two to three weeks
                prevents overgrowth and unwanted scratching. Additionally, ear cleaning is important to check for
                infections, while dental care—such as brushing their teeth or providing dental treats—helps maintain
                oral health and prevents tartar buildup.</p>

            <h3>Exercise & Mental Stimulation</h3>
            <p>Cats are naturally curious and playful creatures that need daily exercise and mental engagement. Playing
                with them using feather wands, balls, or laser pointers keeps them active and prevents boredom.
                Providing scratching posts and cat trees allows them to climb, stretch, and satisfy their instincts
                while protecting your furniture. Rotating their toys regularly helps maintain their interest, and
                installing shelves or perches will encourage climbing and exploration.</p>

            <h3>Health & Veterinary Care</h3>
            <p>Routine veterinary check-ups are essential for keeping your cat in good health. Vaccinations, deworming,
                and flea prevention are necessary to protect against common diseases and parasites. Spaying or neutering
                not only helps prevent unwanted litters but also reduces the risk of certain health issues. Keep an eye
                on any unusual changes in behavior, such as loss of appetite, lethargy, or vomiting, as these can be
                signs of illness that require medical attention.</p>

            <h3>Socialization & Comfort</h3>
            <p>Cats thrive in a safe, comfortable environment where they feel secure. Providing cozy hiding spots and a
                warm bed will make them feel at ease. While cats enjoy affection, they also appreciate personal space,
                so let them come to you when they seek attention. If introducing a new pet, do so gradually to minimize
                stress. A loving and patient approach ensures your cat remains a happy and well-adjusted member of your
                home.</p>
