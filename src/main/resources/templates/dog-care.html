            <h2>Dog Care Guide: Essential Tips for a Happy & Healthy Dog</h2>
            <p>Dogs are loyal and loving companions that bring joy to our lives. Providing them with proper care,
                nutrition, and attention is essential for their well-being. Whether you’re a first-time dog owner or
                looking to refine your pet care routine, here’s everything you need to know to keep your furry friend
                happy and healthy.</p>

            <h3>Nutrition & Feeding</h3>
            <p>A balanced diet is crucial for your dog's health. Puppies require food rich in nutrients to support their
                rapid growth, while adult dogs need a diet suited to their size, breed, and activity level. High-quality
                dog food with proteins, healthy fats, and essential vitamins ensures they stay in top condition. Always
                provide fresh, clean water, and be mindful of toxic foods like chocolate, grapes, onions, and caffeine,
                which can be harmful to dogs.</p>

            <h3>Exercise & Mental Stimulation </h3>
            <p>Dogs thrive on physical activity and mental engagement. Regular exercise, such as daily walks, playtime,
                and interactive games, helps maintain their weight and prevents boredom. Mental stimulation is equally
                important—puzzle toys, training sessions, and social interactions with other dogs or humans keep their
                minds sharp and behavior balanced.</p>

            <h3>Grooming & Hygiene</h3>
            <p>Proper grooming keeps your dog comfortable and healthy. Regular brushing helps remove loose fur and
                prevents matting, especially in long-haired breeds. Bathing should be done as needed, using dog-friendly
                shampoos to avoid skin irritation. Nail trimming every few weeks prevents overgrowth and discomfort,
                while ear cleaning and dental care—such as brushing their teeth or providing dental chews—help maintain
                overall hygiene.</p>

            <h3>Health & Veterinary Care</h3>
            <p>Routine veterinary check-ups are essential to monitor your dog’s health. Vaccinations, deworming, and
                flea and tick prevention are necessary to protect them from diseases and parasites. Spaying or neutering
                not only prevents unwanted litters but also reduces the risk of certain health conditions. Watch for any
                signs of illness, such as loss of appetite, lethargy, excessive scratching, or vomiting, and seek
                veterinary care if needed.</p>

            <h3>Training & Socialization </h3>
            <p>Proper training and socialization are key to raising a well-behaved dog. Basic commands like sit, stay,
                and recall improve obedience and safety. Socializing your dog from an early age with people, other dogs,
                and different environments helps prevent fear and aggression. Positive reinforcement, such as treats and
                praise, makes training enjoyable and effective.</p>

            <h3>Comfort & Safe Environment </h3>
            <p>Dogs need a comfortable and secure space to rest and feel at ease. Providing a cozy bed, fresh water, and
                a designated area for relaxation ensures their well-being. Avoid leaving them alone for long periods, as
                dogs are social animals that thrive on companionship. If introducing a new pet, do so gradually to
                ensure a smooth transition.</p>
